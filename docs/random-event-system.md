# Minerva: Random Event System

Each timestep the system calculates chances for random events to happen. These events help increase the narrative interestingness of the world and in some cases provide catalysts for future character actions.

The probabilities of various event happening are calculated using probability consideration functions that can check character motives and entity stats.
