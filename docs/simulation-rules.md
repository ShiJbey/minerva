# Minerva: Simulation Rules

It is best to think of Minerva like a board game and each character is a player in the game. This page outlines rules that govern Minerva's various systems and mechanics.

## Alliances

Alliances are agreements made between families that they will join any other alliance member during a war.

- Alliances have a max size that can be set in the simulation's config.
- Alliances can only be formed by someone who is head of their family.
- During each simulation step, a family head has the option to start an alliance scheme
- *Alliance Schemes* signal a character's intent to start a new alliance
- Other family heads may join an alliance scheme if:
  - They are not actively in a war
  - Are not actively planning a war
  - Are not in an alliance
  - Are not a member of an active alliance scheme
